# CIS 313: Interm Data Structures

Course Description 

Our main theme is the equation (proposed by Niklas Wirth) "Programs=Algorithms +
Data Structures." First, we will review the asymptotic complexity notations,
loop invariants and recurrence equations, as well as the basic linear data
structures. Then, we will discuss rooted ordered trees and their usage,
especially as search structures (i.e., Binary Search Trees, Red-Black Trees). We
will conclude with some basic sorting algorithms and some analysis using the
newly introduced data structures. The objective of the course is to acquire
facility using tools to analyze (and design!) algorithms (computational
complexity, proofs of correctness) and structuring the information manipulated
by the algorithms.

Expected Learning Outcomes

This course develops basic concepts and applications of data structures in
computer science. The primary topics are familiarity with asymptotic complexity
notations, loop invariants, recurrence equations, analysis of basic linear data
structures along with their applications to computational problems, rooted
ordered trees and their usage and analysis for basic operations of data
structures: searches, additions, deletions, and basic sorting algorithms along
with their analysis using the newly introduced data structures.

Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

- demonstrate facility with asymptotic complexity notations, common functions
  and their asymptotic relations; 
- demonstrate the ability to use asymptotic complexity notations and common
  functions to measure the complexity of basic algorithms (loops, recurrence,
  searches, additions, deletions); 
- demonstrate facility using loop invariants to prove the correctness of loop
  functions; 
- demonstrate facility with basic operations in linear data structures (stacks,
  queues, priority queues), their complexity, and their applications to some
  basic problems (expression evaluation, tree traversal); 
- demonstrate facility with heaps (binary and binomial), procedures for basic
  operations (searches, additions, deletions) and their complexity; 
- demonstrate facility with hash tables and basic hash functions; 
- demonstrate facility with self-balancing trees (AVL, 2-3-4, and Red-Black
  trees), procedures for basic operations, and their complexity;
- demonstrate facility with basic sorting algorithms, their procedures, and
  their complexity; 
- and demonstrate the ability to use the introduced data structures to develop
  efficient algorithms for some basic problems and compute the complexity for
  those algorithms.

Acquired Skills

Upon successful completion of the course, students will have acquired the
following essential skills:

- be able to implement the introduced data structures and their operations using
  a programming language (e.g., Python); 
- be able to design efficient algorithms for some basic problems in computer
  science using the introduced data structures, and implement them using a
  programming language; 
- be able to run the implemented programs in computers and debug the programs if
  necessary.
