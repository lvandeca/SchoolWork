Expected Learning Outcomes
This course sets the foundation for the basic concepts and practices of computer science from 
CIS 210-211. The primary topics are familiarity with the Python programming language.

Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

- understand, develop, and implement algorithms for computational problem solving;
- use structured design and testing methods to develop and implement programs;
- read, write, revise, document, test, and debug code;
- demonstrate robust mental models of data representation and code execution;
- demonstrate good understanding of a high level programming language;
- introduce/implement a sampling of classic computer science problem domains and algorithms;

Acquired Skills
Upon successful completion of the course, students will have acquired the following skills:

- be able to effectively use IDLE in the development and testing of moderate-sized Python programs;
- be able to understand, develop, and implement algorithms for computational problem solving;
- be able to read, write, revise, document, test, and debug code;
- and be able to demonstrate robust mental models of data representation and code execution.
