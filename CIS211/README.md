# CIS 211
Description of Coursework:

 CIS 211 builds on the computational problem solving and Python programming skills developed in 
 CIS 210 and introduces object-oriented programming techniques.

After successfully completing CIS 211, you should be able to:

    - Use classes and objects in an object-oriented programming language, including polymorphism and 
      inheritance. You will develop both an operational understanding (e.g., what happens when we 
      construct an object) and in terms of idiomatic problem solving tactics in object-oriented 
      programming. You will read and write program source code in an object-oriented style, including:

        * Effectively using polymorphism and dynamic dispatch to simplify program logic.
        * Using dynamic dispatch to create listener/notifier connections between program modules.
        * Using abstract classes and methods to organize related concrete subclasses and methods, 
          with inheritance and overriding.
        * Constructing recursive data structures in an object-oriented fashion, with recursive 
          algorithms factored into base and inductive cases by subclass.

    - Understand binary representation and operations such as shifting, bitwise and, and bitwise or 
      sufficiently to write programs that pack fields into an integer and unpack them.

    - Understand fundamental concepts of computer architecture, including the fetch/decode/execute 
      cycle of a central processing unit, registers and main memory, the program counter register, 
      and the relation between higher level languages, assembly language, and machine code. You will 
      not be expected to devise complex assembly language programs, but you will be able to read and 
      understand basic sequences of assembly language instructions including loops.

    - Decompose a moderately complex problem specification into parts that can be solved 
      piece-by-piece, testing your solution at each stage in development.

    - Write software source code that clearly communicates intent to human readers as well as 
      correctly expressing intended instructions for the computer.

    - Reason about asymptotic performance characteristics (that is, relation of time and space 
      requirements to problem size) well enough to devise programs with acceptable performance on
      moderate to large problems. (More sophisticated reasoning about asymptotic performance is 
      developed in CIS 212, CIS 313, and CIS 315.)
