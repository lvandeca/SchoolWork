# All Columns Same Max

A `Grid` object contains a rectangular matrix 
represented as a list of lists of integers. 
Your task is to write a method, 
`Grid.all_columns_same_max`, that returns 
`True` if all the columns of the matrix have 
the same maximum value, and `False` otherwise. 

For full credit (20 points), you should solve this 
without creating any new lists.  A solution that 
creates additional lists will be worth up to 15 points. 

Hint:  Although this can be completed with a 
single method, it may be easier to solve if you 
factor out part of the work into another method.
