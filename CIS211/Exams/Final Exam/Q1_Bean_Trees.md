# Bernie Bots All Flavor Bean Trees

Have you wondered how Bernie Bots All Flavor Beans are 
produced?  You may have imagined a factory, but in fact
they are entirely organic and natural, grown on binary trees. 

The remarkable thing about these trees is that each tree
can produce several flavors of bean.  One flavor of bean
is produced at each leaf of a tree.  It is very important
to determine all the flavors of bean produced by a tree. 
And that's where you come in:  You must write the method 
`flavors`, which returns a set containing all the flavors 
of beans produced by a tree. 

The `set` class is documented at
https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset

Reminders: 
  * You can make a singleton set like this: `set([x])`
  * You can take union like this:
    ```python
    m = set(['a', 'b'])
    n = set(['b', 'c', 'd'])
    u = m.union(n)
    assert u == set(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
    assert u == set(['c', 'd', 'a', 'b'])
    ```
    (note order is not significant)
