Current State of Solution: Project works according to the project specs. Project displays the same output
for small.in, medium.in, and large.in when reversed as small.out, medium.out and large.out respectively. Use
of stringlist.c follows the header from stringlist.h.

Extra Credit: alreverse.c also works according to the project specs and is similar to reverse.c except it uses an
ArrayList rather than a StringList. Similarly it displays the same output for small.in, medium.in, and large.in when reversed as small.out, medium.out, and large.out respectively.
