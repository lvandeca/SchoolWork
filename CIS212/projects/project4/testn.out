gcc
the
c
compiler
on

the

is
a
compilation

that
enables
you
to
compile
source

written
in

textbf

gcc

c
objective
c
fortran
ada
and
go
this
system
has
been
adopted
as
part
of
linux
verb
gcc
is
the
name
of
the
c
compiler
on
linux
verb
gcc
has
a
large
number
of
flags
only
a
few
of
which
we
will
cover
in
this
book
suppose
we
have
a
source
file
named
verb
prog
c
that
we
have
created
using
our
favorite
editor
note
that
by
convention
c
source
files
have
a
verb
c
extension
now
suppose
that
we
wish
to
compile
verb
prog
c
into
a
binary
object
file
the
command
needed
to
do
so
is
begin
adjustwidth
1cm
small
verb
gcc
c
prog
c
newline
normalsize
end
adjustwidth
the
verb
c
flag
tells
verb
gcc
to
compile
only
verb
gcc
also
performs
the
link
task
if
there
are
no
errors
in
verb
prog
c
verb
gcc
will
leave
the
compilation
results
in
a
file
named
verb
prog
o
note
that
verb
o
is
the
conventional
extension
for
an
object
file
verb
gcc
can
also
link
object
files
into
an
executable
program
assuming
that
verb
prog
c
contains
all
of
the
user
defined
logic
needed
then
the
following
command
will
produce
an
executable
program
in
a
file
named
verb
prog
begin
adjustwidth
1cm
small
verb
gcc
o
prog
prog
o
newline
normalsize
end
adjustwidth
finally
you
can
execute
your
program
by
typing
the
following
command
begin
adjustwidth
1cm
small
verb
prog
newline
normalsize
end
adjustwidth
you
may
wonder
why
you
have
to
type
verb
prog
recall
that
verb
bash
uses
the
verb
path
environment
variable
to
find
the
executable
program
file
corresponding
to
the
command
you
have
typed
if
you
simply
typed
verb
prog
verb
bash
would
look
in
each
of
the
directories
found
in
verb
path
by
typing
a
command
with
a
slash
verb
in
it
verb
bash
does
not
search
through
those
directories
instead
simply
executing
the
file
as
typed
and
as
we
recall
from
the
section
ref
sec
dotanddotdot
the
directory
verb
simply
means
the
current
directory
so
verb
prog
will
cause
the
executable
file
named
verb
prog
in
the
current
directory
to
be
executed
and
the
verb
in
the
name
turns
off
the
search
by
verb
bash
of
course
you
could
add
verb
to
the
front
of
verb
path
but
this
can
sometimes
cause
trouble
if
you
give
your
program
an
identical
name
to
one
of
the
standard
programs
provided
in
linux
having
to
invoke
verb
gcc
twice
to
build
verb
prog
may
seem
like
one
invocation
too
many
in
fact
for
simple
programs
like
verb
prog
c
it
can
all
be
done
in
one
command
as
in
begin
adjustwidth
1cm
small
verb
gcc
o
prog
prog
c
newline
normalsize
end
adjustwidth
the
presence
of
a
verb
c
file
in
the
argument
list
causes
verb
gcc
to
first
compile
it
into
an
object
file
to
then
link
that
object
file
into
the
executable
program
emph
and
to
then
delete
the
object
file
most
programs
will
consist
of
multiple
source
files
each
providing
different
functionality
like
different
modules
used
in
a
python
program
as
you
use
the
ecle
cycle
to
debug
your
program
you
seldom
change
all
of
the
source
files
at
once
usually
you
need
to
change
one
source
file
to
resolve
the
current
bug
that
the
program
is
exhibiting
this
only
requires
that
you
compile
that
particular
source
file
again
and
then
link
all
of
the
object
files
together
into
your
executable
program
file
label
sec
cflags
if
your
c
source
file
has
language
errors
verb
gcc
will
report
these
errors
on
standard
error
output
there
are
a
large
number
of
flags
to
verb
gcc
that
control
the
reporting
of
warnings
regarding
your
usage
of
the
c
language
some
of
these
warnings
are
indicative
of
poor
programming
practices
that
will
likely
lead
to
your
program
executing
incorrectly
decades
of
experience
recommend
that
you
specify
verb
w
wall
as
compilation
flags
when
compiling
your
source
files
as
these
warning
flags
will
do
a
reasonable
job
of
reporting
such
poor
programming
practices
therefore
we
strongly
recommend
that
your
compile
command
lines
look
like
begin

prog

the
next
section
describes
a
tool
to
help
you
with
the
ecle

automating
the
necessary
recompiles
and
the
relink
of
your
program
after
you
have

textbf
commands
make
it
should
be
clear
that
one
can
establish
a
set
of
dependencies
between
the
files
that
make
up
your
executable
program
the
executable
program
file
depends
upon
the
constituent
object
files
if
one
of
them
changes
then
the
program
file
must
be
regenerated
by
relinking
the
object
files
likewise
each
object
file
depends
upon
its
source
file
if
the
source
file
has
changed
then
the
object
file
must
be
recreated
by
recompiling
the
source
file
since
the
object
file
is
now
changed
the
executable
program
file
must
be
recreated
clearly
a
tool
that
keeps
track
of
these
and
other
dependencies
and
what
actions
are
required
to
recreate
a
file
that
depends
upon
a
file
that
has
changed
will
be
extremely
useful
verb
make
is
such
a
tool
verb
make
requires
that
you
specify
the
dependencies
between
your
files
it
also
requires
that
you
specify
what
action
to
take
to
recreate
a
dependent
file
when
one
of
the
files
upon
which
it
depends
has
changed
finally
it
has
built
in
rules
for
the
most
common
types
of
actions
e
g
going
from
a
verb
c
to
a
verb
o
how
can
verb
make
possibly
work
recall
from
chapter
2
that
the
file
system
keeps
metadata
about
each
file
and
that
one
such
piece
of
metadata
was
the
modification
date
time
for
the
file
given
a
specification
of
the
dependencies
between
your
files
verb
make
can
determine
if
a
dependent
file
needs
to
be
recreated
if
the
modification
date
of
any
of
the
files
upon
which
the
dependent
file
depends
has
a
later
modification
date
than
the
dependent
file
upon
detection
of
such
a
situation
it
then
applies
the
action
that
you
have
specified
for
recreating
the
dependent
file
or
applies
one
of
the
built
in
implicit
rules
to
recreate
the
dependent
file
which
will
of
course
now
have
a
modification
date
later
than
any
of
the
files
upon
which
it
depends
by
convention
we
keep
all
source
files
for
a
related
set
of
programs
in
a
separate
directory
in
that
directory
a
file
named
verb
makefile
contains
the
specification
of
the
file
dependencies
index
make

and
the
actions
that
should
be
taken

as

side
effect
if

the

it
finds

in
this
case
it
would
recreate

if
necessary
if
all
of
our

were
just
a
single

file
like
verb

verb
make
might
seem
like
overkill
usually
your
programs
will
consists
of
several
source
files
and
need
to
link
to
special
libraries
in
such
cases
capturing
the
knowledge
of
the
dependencies
between
files
and
the
actions
to
take
to
update
a
target
if
it
is
older
than
any
of
the
files
upon
which
it
depends
in
a
verb
makefile
and
using
verb
make
to
make
sure
our
targets
are
up
to
date
is
a
definite
benefit
let
s
assume
that
the
code
in
verb
prog
c
refers
to
functions
defined
in
verb
a
c
and
verb
b

furthermore
let

assume
that
some
global
definitions
needed
by
verb
a

verb
b
c
are
in
verb
globals
h
footnote
we
will
see
later
how
source
code
can
include
information
from
another
file
thus
establishing
a
dependency
of
the
compiled
object
file
upon
the

what
has
changed
from

we
have
augmented
the

for

to
include
verb
a

verb
b

and
we
have
added
dependencies
for
these
two
additional

let

what
we
have
learned
so
far
begin

item
we
store
all
of
the
source
object
and
program
files
for
a
particular
program
in
its
own
directory
item
we
create
a
file
named
verb
makefile
that
captures
the
dependencies
between
source
object
and
program
files
and
provides
custom
rules
needed
to
update
a
target
if
it
needs
to
be
updated
item
we
define
a
variable
named
verb
cflags
at
the
top
of
the
makefile
to
specify
some
of
the
command
arguments
needed
when
compiling
a
c
source
file
to
its
object
file
item
we
define
a
variable
named
verb
objects
at
the
top
of
the
makefile
to
collect
together
the
object
file
names
needed
to
build
our
program
item
the
first
target
shows
the
dependency
of
our
program
file
upon
the
objects
and
provides
the
appropriate
verb
gcc
command
to
link
those
together
to
create
our
program
file
item
this
is
followed
by
a
dependency
line
for
each
object
file
showing
the
dependency
upon
the
relevant
source
file
emph
and
any
files
included
by
that
source
file
item
we
do
not
provide
rules
to
perform
the
compilation
instead
relying
upon
the
built
in
rule
within
verb
make
for
compiling
c
source
files
end
itemize
there
are
many
other
things
one
can
specify
in
the
verb
makefile
which
are
beyond
the
scope
of
this
book
this
final
section
describes
a
couple
of
the
more
common
things
you
will
see
in
makefiles
and
which
you
are
encouraged
to
add
to
your
makefiles
when
appropriate
as
with
our
previous
discussion
we
will
motivate
the
discussion
with

example

all
of
the
programs
that
can
be
built
by
this
verb
makefile
we
didn
t
have
to
do
this
but
it
is
good
practice
especially
as
in
the
future
there
is
every
likelihood
that
you
will
add
one
or
more
new

to
this

we
define
the

without
an
update
rule
if
you
type
verb
make

this
will
cause

to
check
that

the
old

for

is
modified
to
build

note
that
since
we
removed
verb
prog
o
from
verb

we
have
to
include
verb
prog1

in
the

line
and
the

we
also
add
an
equivalent
target
and
rule
for
verb
prog2

we

finally
it
is
common
to
add
a
target
named
verb
clean
when
you
invoke
verb
make
clean
it
executes
the
verb
rm
command
to
remove
all
of
the

files
and
the
program
files
leaving
only
the
source
files
and
the
makefile
note
the
verb
f
flag
to
verb
rm
this
has
the
effect
of
preventing
verb
rm
from
asking
you
if
you
are
really
sure
about
removing
the
specified

it
also
prevents
it
from

you

as
you
can
see
there
are
a
number
of
similarities
between
the
python
and

source
files
as
well
as
a
number
of
differences
the
following
describes
these
similarities
and
differences
begin
itemize
noitemsep
item
the
beginning
of
the
program
is
devoted
to
accessing
functions
and
values
from
other
files
modules
python
requires
you
to
verb
import
math
in
order
to
access
the
square
root
function
the
floating
point
absolute
value
function
and
the
value
of
pi
it
also
requires
you
to
verb
import
sys
in
order
to
access
the
command
arguments
c
requires
you
to
verb
include
math
h
in
order
to
access
the
square
root
function
the
floating
point
absolute
value
function
and
the
value
of
pi
denoted
verb
m
pi
c
does
not
have
a
syntactic
representation
for
exponentiation
so
verb
math
h
also
defines
a
function
verb
double
pow
double
x
double
y
which
raises
verb
x
to
the
verb
y
textsuperscript
th
power
returning
it
as
a
verb
double
note
that
in
c
verb
double
is
the
default
representation
of
a
floating
point
number
c
does
not
require
a
special
include
to
access
arguments
since
the
signature
for
verb
main
has
the
number
of
arguments
and
the
arguments
themselves
passed
in
as
values
the
verb
char
argv
argument
simply
states
that
verb
argv
is
a
list
of
character
strings
just
as
verb
sys
argv
is
in
python
c
also
requires
you
to
verb
include
stdlib
h
in
order
to
access
the
verb
atoi
function
this
converts
a
string
representation
of
a
number
into
an
integer
just
as
the
verb
int
built
in
function
does
in
python
finally
c
requires
you
to
verb
include
stdio
h
in
order
to
access
the
verb
printf
function
unlike
index
c
textbf
c
stdio
printf
python
c
does
not
have
a
built
in
function
to
print
data
on
standard
output
additionally
verb
printf
acts
like
a
combination
of
python
s
verb
print
function
and
the
verb
format
method
on
a
string
item
c
requires
that
the
return
type
of
a
function
be
defined
in
its
signature
additionally
sound
use
of
c
demands
that
you
provide
the
type
of
each
argument
to
a
function
unlike
python
where
all
lines
of
a
block
must
be
at
the
same
indentation
level
c
uses
curly
braces
verb
to
delimit
a
block
thus
the
entire
body
of
verb
approx
pi
is
within
a
pair
of
curly
braces
the
body
of
the
verb
for
loop
in
the
function
is
also
within
a
nested
pair
of
curly
braces
c
requires
that
all
variables
be
declared
before
use
thus
immediately
after
the
signature
line
for
verb
approx
pi
we
declare
variables
named
verb
sum
which
is
a
verb
double
emph
and
initialized
to
verb
0
0
and
verb
i
which
is
an
verb
int
note
that
immediately
after
the
verb
for
statement
we
also
declare
verb
di
which
is
a
verb
double
and
is
assigned
the
value
of
verb
i
converted
to
a
verb
double
explicit
casts
from
one
type
to
another
are
done
as
shown
verb
di
is
only
defined
in
the
body
of
the
verb
for
loop
not
outside
of
it
the
computation
of
verb
sum
is
identical
to
our
python
code
except
that
each
occurrence
of
verb
x
y
had
to
be
converted
to
an
invocation
of
verb
pow
x
y
the
verb
return
is
also
identical
note
that
each
statement
in
the
function
is
terminated
by
a
semicolon
verb
this
is
because
c
allows
statements
to
span
multiple
lines
as
well
as
allowing
multiple
statements
to
be
placed
on
a
single
line
item
verb
main
is
very
similar
between
the
two
languages
of
course
in
c
we
need
to
declare
each
variable
before
use
the
call
to
verb
printf
looks
a
bit
strange
the
first
argument
is
like
the
string
template
upon
index
c
textbf
c
stdio
printf
which
we
invoked
the
verb
format
method
in
our
python
code
although
verb
printf
uses
percent
signs
to
specify
where
an
argument
value
should
be
placed
unlike
the
curly
braces
used
in
python
another
difference
is
that
there
is
no
format
specifier
equivalent
to
verb
thus
we
had
to
multiply
the
fractional
difference
by
verb
100
finally
since
verb
is
the
special
character
in
the
format
string
for
verb
printf
we
had
to
double
it
in
order
for
it
to
print
out
a
percent
sign
end

when

are
those
that
convert

in

one
must
exercise
caution

uses
make
assumptions
about
contiguity
of
sequences
of
digits
or
letters
or
about
the
relationship
between
lower

it
is

each

it

in

such
a
situation
may
be
a
strong
indication

a
problem
in

verb
gcc
has
provided
a
set
of
extensions
for
specifying

in
your

one
of

enables

to

that
a

emph
on

if
you
flag
a
parameter

with
this
attribute
verb
gcc
will
not
issue
the
corresponding
warning
since
you
have
proactively
indicated
that
it
will
not
be
used
in
our
case
we
are
not
using
the
command
arguments
so
flagging
verb
argc
and
verb
argv
as
unused
is
appropriate
so
how
do
we
determine
if
one
string
is
included
in
another
string
we
could
write
a
function
to
do
this
and
we
will
show
this
later

in

we
should
look
in

to
see
if
such
a

this

a
program
that
has
a
static
pattern
to
search
for
is
not
particularly
useful
as
we
would
have
to
edit
and
recompile
the
program
to
search
for
other
patterns
we
will
look
at
how
to
make
the
program
more
dynamic

c
variables
external
a
c
program
consists
of
a
set
of
external
objects
which
are
either
variables
or
functions
external
variables
are
defined
outside
of
any
function
and
are
thus
potentially
accessible
by
many
functions
functions
are
emph
always
external
since
c
does
not
permit
functions
to
be
defined
inside
of
other
functions
external
variables
and
functions
have
the
property
that
all
references
to
them
using
the
same
name
even
from
functions
compiled
separately
are
references
to
the
same
thing
the
emph
scope
of
a
name
is
the
part
of
the
program
within
which
the
name
can
be
used
for
an
automatic
variable
declared
at
the
beginning
of
a
block
the
scope
is
the
block
in
which
the
name
is
declared
the
scope
of
an
external
variable
or
a
function
lasts
from
the
point
at
which
it
is
declared
to
the
end
of
the
file
being
compiled
if
an
external

is
to
be

a

they
do
not
create

only

an

enable
two
types
of

1
by
functions
within
a

and
2
by
functions
in
other

often
we
require
external
storage
so
that
functions
within
a
file
can
share
but
wish
to
hide
that
information
from
functions
in
other
source
files
the
keyword
verb
static
if
prefixed
to
external
variable
definitions
achieves
this
level
of
hiding
i
e
all
functions
in
the
source
file
can
access
the
static
variables
but
they
are
hidden
from
functions
in

these

we

we
will
create

admittedly
verb

pointers
to
structures
act
somewhat
like
object
references
in
object
oriented
languages
nearly
all
object
oriented
languages
python
included
have
a
base
class
verb
object
from
which
all
other
classes
inherit
c
provides
a
generic
pointer
verb
void
any
pointer
can
be
cast
to
verb
void
and
back
again
without
loss
of
information
verb
void
is
used
to
construct
modules
that
provide
generic
capabilities
at
runtime
we
will
be
using
these
in
our
abstract
data
types
one
important
aspect
of
verb
void
pointers
is
that
you
emph
cannot
dereference
them
attempts
to
do
so
will
generate
a
compiler
or
a
runtime
error
the
most
common
initial
exposure
to
verb
void
pointers
is
through
the
dynamic
memory
allocation
routines
defined
in
verb
stdlib

c
heap

many
of
the
data
structures
used
to
solve
problems
grow
dynamically
i
e
one
cannot
know
when
the
program
starts
how
much
memory
a
particular
data
structure
will
occupy
languages
like
c
and
python
provide
emph
heap
memory
that
can
be
allocated
as
a
data
structure
needs
to
grow
in
python
every
time
you
invoke
a
constructor
e
g
verb
list
verb
dict
verb
set
or
the
constructor
for
any
class
memory
is
allocated
from
the
heap
python
keeps
track
of
the
references
to
heap
allocated
memory
when
there
are
no
more
references
to
a
chunk
of
heap
allocated
memory
it
can
be
returned
to
the
heap
this
is
known
as
emph
garbage
collection
c
provides
a
set
of
routines
for
allocating
and
freeing
heap
memory
in
verb
stdlib
h
but
does
not
track
references
to
heap
allocated
memory
so
does
not
provide
garbage
collection
thus
your
program
must
emph
itself
keep
track
of
references
to
heap
blocks
and
free
blocks
when
there
are
no
more
references
failure
to
do
so
causes
emph
memory
leaks
in
your
program
which
must
be
assiduously
avoided
we
will
discuss
the
verb
valgrind
program
later
in
this
chapter
which
helps
you
find
memory
leaks
the

what
does
this

so
that

we
declare
a

the
appropriate
type
we
then
call
verb

using
verb
sizeof
to
specify
the
number
of
bytes
needed
for
an
integer
we
use
the
cast
verb
int
to
explicitly
convert
from
a
verb
void
pointer
returned
by
verb
malloc
to
an
verb
int
we
check
to
see
if
the
verb
malloc
was
successful
if
so
we
use
the
allocated
memory
then
return
it
to
the

when
your

we
use

to
allocate

that
must
survive

they
are

your

the

a
function
itself
is
not
a
variable
in
c
but
it
is
possible
to
define
pointers
to
functions
these
can
be
assigned
to
pointer
variables
placed
in

passed
as
arguments
to

returned
by

let
s
look
at
one
use
of
function
pointers
consider
a
sort
program
that
sorts
strings
in
files
like
the
standard
verb
sort
program
in
linux
sometimes
we
want
to
sort
the
strings
lexicographically
i
e
as
character
strings
at
other
times
there
may
be
a
number
at
the
beginning
of
each
line
and
we
would
like
the
lines
to
be
sorted
numerically
according
to
the
leading
number
as
with
the
standard
verb
sort
program
the
user
should
be
able
to
choose
the
type
of
sort
by
specifying
a
flag
argument
when
invoking
the
program
the
pseudocode
for
our
verb
main
looks
something
like
the
following
begin

read

end
adjustwidth
assuming
that
there
is
a
verb
sort
function
that
performs
the
textit
sort
them
part
of
the
pseudocode
we
need
to
have
some
way
to
inform
that
function
how
we
want
the
strings
to
be
compared
if
the
function
prototype
for
verb
sort
has
the
following
form
we
can
achieve
this
flexible
form
of
sorting

what
does
this

tell
us
begin
itemize
noitemsep
item
verb

sorts
the
array

item
it
actually
sorts
a
slice
of
the

specified
by
verb
left
and
verb
right
and
item
whenever
verb
sort
needs
to
compare
two
entries
in
verb
lines
it
will
invoke
the
function
pointed
to
by
verb
comp
this
function
takes
two
verb

arguments
and
the

from

will
be

care
when
defining
function
pointers
due
to
the
precedence
of
c
s
operators
you
have
to
be
careful
when
defining
function
pointers
for
example
consider
the
following
function
prototype
begin
adjustwidth
1cm
small
verb
int
f
void
arg
newline
normalsize
end
adjustwidth
this
defines
a
function
named
verb
f
that
returns
a
pointer
to
an
integer
while
begin
adjustwidth
1cm
small
verb
int
pf
void
arg
newline
normalsize
end
adjustwidth
defines
verb
pf
as
a
pointer
to
a
function
returning
an
integer
in
general
when
defining
a
function
pointer
you
should
always
surround
the
name
of
the
pointer
verb
name
by
parentheses
to
avoid
such
mistakes
we
will
use
function
pointers
when
constructing
abstract

a

the
keyword
verb
struct
introduces
a
structure
declaration
which
is
a
list
of
variable
declarations
enclosed
in
curly
braces
the
verb
tag
is
an
optional
name
that
can
be
used
to
refer
to
this

type
in
the
future
the
variables
named
in
the

within
the

are
called

a

defines
a

it
is
equivalent
to
a
python

for
which
there
are
no

e
g
linked

makes

the
most

use
of

is
with
respect
to

let

this
particular
style
is
extremely
common
i
e
the
tag
for
the
structure
starts
with
a
lower
case
letter
while
the
synonym
starts
with
an
upper

in
this
example
the
tag
is

the
synonym
for

is

we
can
declare

note
that
verb
typedef
does
emph
not
create
a
new

in
any
sense
it
merely
adds
a

existing
type
for
example
we
can
declare
variables
as

both

achieve

i
e
both
verb
p1
and

have
exactly
the

properties
it
is
also
possible

for
function

for
example
begin

section
environment

conventions
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
for
providing
information
to
programs
that
you
invoke
in
verb
bash
begin
itemize
noitemsep
item
a
program
can
indicate
that
it
will
obtain
the
value
of
an
environment
variable
if
it
is
defined
for
example
verb
make
will
obtain
the
value
of
an
environment
variable
verb
cflags
if
it
is
defined
in
its
environment
and
will
use
that
value
unless
verb
cflags
is
explicitly
defined
in
the
makefile
in
this
latter
case
it
will
use
the
value
defined
in
the
makefile
footnote
you
are
strongly
advised
to
emph
not
define
texttt
cflags
in
the
environment
and
to
emph
always
define
texttt
cflags
at
the
top
of
each
makefile
from
personal
experience
you
will
forget
that
you
have
defined
texttt
cflags
in
the
environment
when
you
port
your
code
to
another
system
and
spend
quite
a
bit
of
time
figuring
out
what
is
wrong
item
a
program
can
indicate
that
it
will
change
its
functionality
if
particular
flags
are
specified
in
the
command
line
these
flags
come
in
two
flavors
begin
itemize
label

item
short
flags
these
are
of
the
form
verb
character
where
verb
character
is
replaced
by
a
single
letter
the
man
page
for
the
program
will
tell
you
how
the
program
interprets
such
an
argument
by
convention
an
argument
of
this
form
indicates
to
the
program
that
you
are
selecting
a
particular
way
that
the
program
should
perform
its
function
for
example
verb
ls
without
a
flag
indicates
that
verb
ls
should
list
the
names
of
the
files
in
the
current
working
directory
verb
ls
l
on
the
other
hand
indicates
that
verb
ls
should
display
a
emph
long
listing
of
each
file
in
the
current
working
directory
one
per
line
most
commands
permit
one
to
specify
several
short
flag
characters
in
a
single
argument
consider
verb
ls
lrt
the
verb
l
flag
indicates
that
one
should
do
a
long
listing
the
verb
r
flag
indicates
that
it
should
reverse
the
order
of
the
presentation
and
the
verb
t
flag
indicates
that
the
files
should
be
ordered
by
modification
time
it
is
perfectly
legal
to
invoke
this
as
verb
ls
l
r
t
but
users
require
compounding
individual
flags
so
often
that
by
convention
most
programs
support
this
approach
sometimes
an
argument
of
this
type
requires
an
additional
piece
of
information
for
example
verb
ls
w
50
indicates
that
verb
ls
should
restrict
its
output
to
50
columns
on
the
output
the
number
of
columns
verb
50
must
follow
the
verb
w
immediately
on
the
command
line
as
a
separate
argument
to
the
command
when
a
short
flag
requires
additional
information
it
cannot
be
combined
with
other
short
flags
emph
unless
it
is
the
last
short
flag
as
in
verb
ls
lw
65
item
long
flags
such
flags
are
introduced
by
two
hyphens
as
in
verb
all
or
verb
ls
width
50
in
such
cases
the
flag
text
verb
width
and
its
value
verb
50
are
a
single
string
argument
as
seen
by
the
program
end
itemize
item
all
other
arguments
are
usually
names
of
files
occasionally
for
example
for
programs
like
verb
grep
the
first
non
flag
argument
is
considered
a
pattern
for
which
verb
grep
must
search
in
the
files
named
in
subsequent
arguments
end
itemize
from

you
should
infer
that
linux

strongly
discourages

to
remove
the
leading
hyphen
if
you
are
writing

program
in

you
will

before
processing
any
command
arguments
item
while
some
programs
enable
one
to
intersperse
flags
between
filenames
it
is
strongly
recommended
that
you
emph
not
do
that
in
other
words
all
flags
should
occur
before
the
first
non

argument
item
if
an

with
verb
and
it
is
emph
not
a
bare
verb
it
is
a
flag
if
it
emph
is

most

consider
this

be
shorthand
for
verb
standard
input
item
for
a
flag
if
the
next
character
is
another
verb
it
is

the

will
depend
upon
this
distinction
begin

item
if

and
the
last

in

they

not

another

enormously
useful
tool
nearly
every

makes
extensive
use

it

essential
that
all

and
use
errors
be
eliminated

sections
have
demonstrated
how
different
types
of
memory
misuse
manifest
themselves
in
the
output
from

the
only
time
you
should
be
satisfied
that
you
have
eliminated
all
problems
with
your

use
is
if

it
is
likely
that
you
have
been
using
computers
since
you
were
very
young
i
recall
sitting
my
2
year
old
niece
down
in
front
of
one
of
the
first
macintosh
textsuperscript
tm
computers
to
play
a
game
called
lode
runner
in
1985
admittedly
a
poor
baby
sitting
approach
but
it
did
the
trick
she
happily
punched
the
keys
for
nearly
an
hour
while
i
was
trying
to
finish
up
a
section
of
a

the
very
first
interactive
computers
had
a
single
console
upon
which
output
from
programs
was
displayed
and
through
which
input
could
be
provided
using
the
keyboard
the
input
and
output
speeds
on
such
consoles
were
maddeningly
slow
but
one
could
at
least
get
on
with
the
job
the
console
shown
in
the
figure
also
had
a
paper

very
early
form

as
processors
became
more
powerful
and
memory
became
more
plentiful
computers
were
fitted
with
serial
line
devices
that
enabled
one
to
connect
terminals
to
the
system
such
terminals
provided
a
similar
interface
to
the
system
as
the
console
but
usually
consisted
of
a
cathode
ray
tube
for
display
and
a
keyboard
a
window
of
80
character
lines
x
24
lines
of
fixed
width
font
characters
was
provided
on
the
crt
and
the
typical
transmission
speeds
of
such
devices
was
30
times
faster
than
for
the
earlier
consoles
multiple
people
could
be
connected
to
the
system
at
one
time
leading
to
time
sharing
systems
one
particular
time
sharing
system
that
was
popular
in
universities
and
among
computer
science
researchers
was
unix
textsuperscript
tm
unix
textsuperscript
tm
was
developed
by
ken
thompson
and
dennis
ritchie
at
bell
laboratories
along
with
contributions
from
many
of
the
other
researchers
at
the
bell
labs
murray
hill
facility
it
had
originally
been
implemented
to
ease
the
withdrawal
experienced
by
thompson
and
ritchie
when
they
were
recalled
from
the

was
used
internally
within

until
thompson
spent
a
sabbatical
year
at
berkeley
as
with
all
good
computer
scientists
thompson
took
his
environment
unix

with
him
when
others
at
berkeley
discovered
the
power
and
simplicity
of
the
environment
western

bell
labs
parent
company
was
persuaded
to
create
an
academic
license
that
enabled
berkeley
and
other
university
computer
science
departments
to
have
access
to
the
system
students
that
graduated
from
institutions
in
which
unix
textsuperscript
tm
was
used
found
themselves
also
experiencing
withdrawal
when
they
went
off
to
employment
in
industry
or
the
national
laboratories
the
licensing
of
unix
textsuperscript
tm
was
restricted
to
universities
computer
system
vendors
such
as
hp
ibm
and
sun
observed
this
demand
and
negotiated
licensing
arrangements
with
western
electric
to
produce
vendor
specific
versions
of
unix
textsuperscript
tm
for
their
workstations
and
servers
hp
hp
ux
ibm
aix
sun
sunos
since
these
were
vendor
specific
they
presented
slightly
different
libraries
and
system
calls
complicating
porting
of
code
between
the
platforms
to
eliminate
most
of
the
differences
the
vendors
through
the
activities
of
a
variety
of
consortia
worked
with
the
ieee
to
create
the
posix
standards
to
define
a
standard
set
of
library
functions
that
could
be
depended
upon
when
programming
on
a
posix
compliant
system
one
particularly
unique
innovation
of
unix
textsuperscript
tm
was
how
it
read
commands
from
a
user
commonly
called
a
command
line
interpreter
cli
prior
operating
systems
usually
provided
a
privileged
program
sometimes
embedded
in
the
kernel
itself
for
reading
and
executing
commands
typed
by
the
user
through
their
terminal
the
unix
textsuperscript
tm
kernel
provided
a
complete
set
of
system
calls
enabling
processes
to
create
and
manage
other
processes
thus
the
cli
could
simply
be
another
program
these
user
level
cli
s
have
become
known
as
shells
since
the
very
first
such
cli
was
called
the
shell
and
the
command
one
typed
to
invoke
the
shell
was
texttt
sh
texttt
sh
was
written
by
steve
bourne
beginning
in
1991
linus
torvalds
began
work
to
create
a
new
free
operating
system
kernel
this
kernel
coupled
with
the
applications
from
the
gnu
project
has
eventually
become
known
as
linux
linux
is
open
source
licensed
under
the
gnu
general
public
license
given
its
open

nature
it
is
now

the
primary
interface
between
a
user
and
linux
is
the
terminal
window

a
window
on
the
screen
that
emulates
the
80x24

found
on
earlier

a
pun
on

shell
that
it

reads
each
command
line
typed
by
the
user
in
the
window
creates
one
or
more
processes
needed
to
execute
the
command
line
and
normally
waits
for
those
processes
to
finish
execution
before
prompting
the
user
for
another
command
line
this
is
obviously
quite
different
from
the
point
and
click
mechanism
with
which
you
are
undoubtedly
familiar
linux
systems
do
provide
one
or
more
graphical
user
interfaces

support

is
nearly
always
performed
using
the
command

interface
provided
by
a
terminal
window
in
which
texttt

item
the

breaks
up
the

of
input
that
you
type

separate
words
the
words
can
be
separated
by
blanks
or
tabs
or
by
punctuation
like
the

item
the
first
word
in

is
the
program
to

we
will
discuss
later
how
the

looks
for
the

file
that
corresponds
to
that

item
the
other
words
in
the

are
provided
to
the
program
as
a
list
of
words
for
it
to
do
with
as
it
sees
fit
texttt
echo
simply
prints
each
of
these
words
placing
a
single
space
between
each
pair
of
words
item
it
does
not
matter
how
many
spaces
or
tabs
separate
two
words
it
does
not
change
the
list
of
words
that
the
shell
gives
to
the
program
item
if
you
want
to
have
many
words
in
a
single
argument
you
can
quote
the
phrase
using
verb
or
verb
in
the
last
example
above
texttt

received
a
list
with
a
single

in
it
consisting
of
the
phrase
verb
this
and
that
emph
without
the
quote
characters
end
itemize
we
saw
earlier
that
texttt
bash
gives
a
special
meaning
to
the
character
verb
now
we
see
that
it
gives
special
meaning
to
verb
and
verb
as
well
in
fact
texttt
bash
gives
special
meanings
to
most
non
alphanumeric
characters
if
you
want
to
provide
an
argument
to
a
program
that
contains
a
non
alphanumeric
character
the
easiest
way
to
prevent
the
shell
from
giving
it
its
special
meaning
is
to
quote
the
argument

command
arguments
that

are
considered
flags
to

i

they

finally
if

in

that
a

this

assertion
is
not
completely
true

after

what
about
the
other
arguments
to

most

need

on
files
so
the
non

arguments
are
typically
filenames
there
are
other
sorts
of
information
that
a
command
might
need
for
example
a
program
that
searches
for
textual
patterns
in
a
file
requires
at
least
one
argument
indicating
the
pattern
we
wish
to
find
in
the
last
four
examples
above
we
provided
as
an
argument
to
texttt
ls
what
does
that
mean
as
we
mentioned
previously
most
of
the
non
alphanumeric
characters
available
on
the
keyboard
have
a
special
meaning
to
texttt
bash
when
texttt
bash
breaks
up
the
command
into
words
it
looks
for
four
particular
special
characters
verb

the
last
four
texttt
ls
examples
above
indicates
that
texttt

have
rules
about

legal
filenames
firstly
there
is
usually
a
limit
on
the
length
of
a
filename
early
operating
systems
had
very
severe
restrictions
linux
restricts
the
length
of
a
filename
to
255
characters
it
is
unusual
for
anyone
to
want
to
type
that
many
characters
as
an
argument
to
a
command
so
in
practice
you
will
usually
use
far
fewer
letters
in
your
filenames
secondly
what
are
the
legal
characters
in
a
filename
linux
allows
any
character
in
a
filename
except
for
texttt
and
a
null
character
this
does
emph
not
mean
that
you
should
start
putting
lots
of
strange
characters
in
your
filenames

linux

the

assuming

the

starts

each

are
separated
by

while
this
overloading
of
the
use
of

may
seem
strange
one
quickly
becomes
accustomed
to
it
given
such
a
hierarchical
structure
it
is
common
to
use
family

to
describe
the
relationships
between

if
a

texttt

a

texttt
b
texttt
a
is
the

is
the

to

you
may
wonder
why
we
need

it
can
be
used
as
the

as

to
access

no

you
can

seems
a

very
next

showing
you
how
this
is
done
why
might
we
want
to
change
texttt
path
we
ve
previously
discussed
the
texttt
usr
local
branch
of
the
file
system
as
a
place
where
site
specific
programs
are
typically
installed
on
your
system
you
really
wouldn
t
want
to
put
these
programs
in
texttt
usr
bin
since
the
next
release
of
the
operating
system
would
require
you
to
remember
all
of
the
non
standard
programs
that
you
placed
in
texttt
usr
bin
so
that
you
could
reinstall
them
sometimes
you
want
a
site
specific
version
of
one
of
the
standard
programs
and
whenever
that
program
is
invoked
you
want
the
site
specific
version
to
be
found
instead
of
the
standard
one
and
finally
you
might
want
to
have
a
number
of
your
own
programs
it
is
very
easy
to
do
that
you
use
regularly
and
you
want
texttt
bash
to
be
able
to
find
them
in
the
same
way
note
that
the
search
performed
by
texttt
bash
goes
from
left
to
right
in
the
sequence
of
directories
that
make
up
texttt
path
thus
if
you
want
to
find
your
version
of
texttt
ls
instead
of
the
one
stored
in
texttt
usr
bin
then
your
version
will
have
to
be
in
a
directory
that
is
earlier
in
texttt
path
than
texttt
usr
bin

only
two
tricky
things
in
this
exercise
begin
itemize
noitemsep
item
as
can
be
done
in
most
programming
languages
we
can
define
a
new
value
for
a
variable
in
terms
of
its
previous
value
thus
the
expression
verb
path
usr
local
bin
path
causes
the
shell
to
append
the
current
value
of
texttt
path
verb
path
to
the
string
texttt
usr
local
bin
and
to
assign
the
concatenated
string
as
the
new
value
of
texttt
path
and
index
commands
textbf

sudo
item
there
is
a
command
available
in
linux
texttt
sudo
that
allows
you
to
become
the
root
user
to
exercise
one
command
if
you
perform
verb
ls
dl
usr
local

you
will
see
that
it
is
owned
by
the
texttt
root
user
and
you
do
not
have
write
permission
to
that
directory
by
using
the
texttt
sudo
command
you
can
perform
the
requested
command
first
texttt
cp
to
create
the
copy
there
and
later
texttt
rm
to
remove
the
copy
as
if
you
were
the

the

virtual

knows
that
your

so
far
we
have
focused
on
typing
commands
on
the
keyboard
to
the
shell
the
shell
parses
each
command
to
determine
which
program
to
run
it
creates
a
process
to
run
that
program
and
the
shell
makes
the
arguments
and
the
environment
available
to
that
program
the
shell
then
waits
for
that
program
to
finish
before
prompting
the
user
for
another
command
all
of
our
examples
so
far
take
some
action
and
output
the
results
to
the
screen
if
a
program
detects
something
wrong
it
displays
an
error
message
on

computers
would
be
not
nearly

there
are
several
things
going
on
here
that
make
this
work
begin
itemize
noitemsep
item
when
texttt
cat
is
invoked
if
any
arguments
are
supplied
it
copies
the
contents
of
those
files
to
the
terminal
window
item
if
invoked
without
any
arguments
it
copies
the
standard
input
to
the
terminal
window
item
in
the
first
case
above
where
texttt
cat
was
invoked
without
arguments
the
standard
input
was
the
keyboard
thus
you
had
to
type
on
the
keyboard
to
provide
texttt
cat
with
characters
that
it
could
write
to
the
terminal
window
note
that
textit
ctl
d
is
the
character
to
type
at
the
keyboard
to
indicate
an
end
of
file
item
in
the
second
case
above
the
shell
interpreted
verb
shopping
list
to
mean
that
standard
input
for
texttt
cat
should
come
from
texttt
shopping
list
not
from
the
keyboard
it
resets
standard
input
for
texttt
cat
to
be
from
the
file
emph
and
removes
verb
shopping
list
from
the
set
of
arguments
made
available
to
texttt
cat
item
texttt
cat
doesn
t
care
as
it
has
been
invoked
without
any
arguments
so
it
simply
reads
from
standard
input
until
an
end
of
file
is
detected
end
itemize
thus
we
see
that
texttt
bash
interprets
yet
another
special
character
texttt
textless
to
indicate
that
the
standard
input
for
the
program
should
come
from
a
file
rather
than
from
the
keyboard
this
redirection
occurs
without
emph
any
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
program
texttt
cat
in
this
case
correct
behavior
does
demand
that
the
program
read
from
standard
input
if
it
has
not
received
any
file
arguments
footnote
some
programs
such
as
texttt
cat
understand
an
argument
consisting
solely
of
a
hyphen
texttt
to
mean
that
it
should
also
read
from
the
standard
input
as
in

parentheses
more
special

all

appropriately
serialized
can
be

way

this
also
shows
you
that
the

executed
by
a

in

are
the

it
stands
to
reason

since

it

that
we
can

you
might
think
that
the
right
way
to
do
this
would
be
to
select
another
special
character
say
frowny
and
for
texttt
bash
to
interpret
frowny
texttt

to
mean
redirect
standard
error
output
to
texttt
filename
and
to
interpret
frowny
frowny
texttt
filename
to
mean
to
redirect
standard
error
output
to
the
end
of
texttt
filename
unfortunately
texttt
bash
has
used
up
all
of
the
special
characters
we
have
not
introduced
all
of
them
yet
instead
texttt
bash
interprets
texttt
2
textgreater

and
texttt
2

to
mean
that
standard

should
be

does

the

in

it
redirects

in
the
previous

we
described
how
texttt
bash
performs
input
output
and
error
output
redirection
index
bash
textbf
bash
pipes
being
able
to
do
so
would
be
pretty
useless
if
commands
did
not
read
from
standard
input
by
default
write
results
to
standard
output
by
default
and
write
error
messages
to
standard
error
output
by
default
given
that
programs
do
conform
to
this
standard
texttt
bash
can
now
provide
significant
expressive
and
computational
power
by
managing
multiple
processes
and
enabling
these
processes
to
talk
to
each
other
emph
without
knowing
that
they
are
doing
so
this
is
done
through
an
abstraction
known
as
emph
pipelines
suppose
you
wanted
to
know
the
number
of
files
in
a
particular
directory
how
would
you
do
so
one
has
to
invoke
texttt
ls
on
the
directory
to
access
its
contents
we
could
make
a
special
version
of
texttt
ls
that
understood
a
flag
verb
count
which
would
indicate
that
it
would
simply
print
the
number
of
files
found
in
each
directory
specified
on
the
command
line
verb
all
could
also
be
specified
with
this
new
flag
indicating
that
hidden
files
that
start
with
a
period
verb
would
also
be
counted
seems
reasonable
so
far
but
we
already
have
texttt
wc
which
will
count
lines
words
and
characters
in
a
file
if
there
was
some
easy
way
to
put
the
output
of
texttt
ls
into
a
file
and
then
have
texttt
wc
take
its
input
from
that
file
we
would
have
a
solution
without
having
to
modify
texttt
ls
but
we
just
discussed
redirection
in
the
last
section
so
we
can
already
do
this
let

try
it

the

it
is
clear
that
this
works
there
s
the
problem
that
we
have
to
choose
a
temporary
filename
for
the
output
that
does
not
collide
with
one
of
the
files
already
in
the
directory
which
we
did
emph
not
do
that
the
temporary
file
will
be
listed
by
texttt
ls
and
thus
be
counted
by
texttt
wc
and
that
we
have
to
remember
to
remove
the
temporary
file
after
we
are
done
operating
systems
have
long
supported
the
ability
for
processes
running
programs
to
communicate
with
each
other
called
emph
interprocess
communication
ipc
oddly
enough
smiley
linux
supports
several
different
types
of
ipc
that
enable
different
styles
of
interaction
in
this
case
we
would
like
to
have
a
way
for
two
child
processes
footnote
in
the
same
way
that
we
discussed
parent
child
relationships
between
directories
and
files
when
texttt
bash
creates
a
process
to
run
your
command
it
is
the
process
s
parent
and
the
process
is
texttt
bash
s
child
to
interact
with
one
process
writing
data
as
if
to
a
file
and
the
other
process
reading
that
data
as
if
coming
from
a
file
linux
provides
an
abstraction
in
the
operating
system
called
a
emph
pipe
which
provides
this
ability
each
pipe
has
a
write
end
and
a
read
end
if
one
process
is
given
the
write
end
and
another
the
read
end
the
two
processes
interact
without
knowing
that
a
process
is
on
the
other
end
texttt
bash
is
already
able
to
redirect
input
output
and
error
output
so
if
it
knows
you
wanted
to
plumb
your
two
processes
together
it
could
ask
the
operating
system
for
a
pipe
redirect
one
process
s
standard
output
to
the
pipe
and
the
redirect
the
other
process
s
standard
input
to
the
pipe
as
you
might
have
guessed
texttt
bash
has
another
special
character
that
indicates
the
need
for
plumbing
two
processes
together

a

the

the

then
breaks
that

up

separated

it
then
creates
a

and
the

of

after

it
waits

that

are
only
concerned
with

they
do
not

suppose
that
you

we

fortunately
with

all
one
has

is

if

finally
if

replaces

how

provided

and
presented
a

using
the

programming
in

we

introduce
additional
programs
that
are
needed
to
develop
software
written
in

for
use
on
linux
and
other
posix
compliant
systems
we
then
moved
on
to
discuss
the
major
aspects
of

system
and
the
most
important
directories
in
the
file
system
for
a
software
developer
armed
with
knowledge
of
the

system
we
then
returned
to
additional
features
of

shell
that
enable
sophisticated
use
of

finally
we
described
how
to
create

that

for

with
other

both
in
uncompressed

compressed
formats
