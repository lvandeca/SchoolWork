# CIS 212

Course Description 

This 3rd course in the CIS introductory sequence covers working in Linux,
programming using the C language, and constructing and using basic data
structures. It is a projects-driven course. The projects help prepare you for
the rest of the major. As with all project-driven courses, you must also master
the theory behind the practice, as well.

Expected Learning Outcomes

This course continues development of the basic concepts and practices of
computer science from CIS 210-211. The primary topics are familiarity with the
Linux environment, programming in C, basic complexity analysis, and basic data
structures: stacks, queues, linked lists, deques, priority queues, maps, and
heaps.

Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

- demonstrate facility using the default Linux shell (bash) including command
  invocation, IO redirection, file system navigation, environment variables,
  pipes and multiprocessing, and compression and file packaging; 
- describe what occurs at each step of the edit-compile-link-execute cycle of
  program development; demonstrate the ability to program moderate-sized
  programs using the C programming language; 
- demonstrate the ability to use gdband valgrind to find and correct
  programmatic and memory errors in C programs; construct the interface
  specification for an abstract data type; 
- program one or more implementations of an abstract data type interface
  specification; 
- be able to determine from inspection the "Big-O" complexity of a piece of
  code; 
- be able to measure running time for a particular program within the shell and
  by inserting source code instrumentation; 
- demonstrate the ability to create a stack, queue, linked list, deque, 
- priority queue, map, and heap using the C programming language; 
- and demonstrate the ability to use a stack, queue, linked list, deque,
  priority queue, map, or heap to solve a problem
