# CIS 314: Computer Organization


Course Description

Introduction to computer organization and instruction-set architecture - digital
logic design, binary arithmetic, design of central processing unit and memory,
machine-level programming.  In addition to machine-level programming, this
course will provide an introduction to the C programming language in the context
of bitwise operations, memory management, pointers to memory, and translation
between C and the x86-64 instruction set architecture.


Expected Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

- Proficiently use bitwise operators to solve problems efficiently in C.
- Demonstrate knowledge of unsigned, signed, and floating-point number encodings
  and binary, decimal, and hexadecimal representations.
- Demonstrate usage of a typical instruction set architecture and understand the
  relationship between C code and data-transfer, arithmetic, and control
  instructions.
- Demonstrate usage of the call stack, including call/return instructions,
  argument passing, local scope, and register conventions.
- Demonstrate knowledge of stack vs heap allocation, array and struct data
  types.
- Comprehend the basic functionality of a modern pipelined microprocessor.
- Demonstrate how various optimization techniques affect assembly code and
  therefore program performance.
- Understand the modern memory hierarchy, including caching, and how it affects
  performance.

Acquired Skills

Upon successful completion of the course, students will have acquired the
following essential skills:

- be able to use bitwise operations to efficiently solve problems in C.
- be able to write iterative and recursive algorithms in C and assembly
  language.
- be able to debug C code using gdb, debug assembly code using an interactive
  assembler/debugger.
- be able to optimize C code with respect to instruction counts, unpredictable
  branches, and memory-access patterns.
- be able to implement a basic direct-mapped caching solution.
